# SeaDawg

SeaDawg is a library that implements the online algorithm for Compact Direct Acyclic Word Graph (CDAWG).

The version implemented is as defined in the [On-Line Construction ofCompact Directed Acyclic Word Graphs](https://str.i.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~inenaga/papers/dam-cdawg.pdf) by Shunsuke Inenaga et. al.

Licensed under the MPL 2.0 since it is fair enough.

# Why
1. **Did it for fun.** Was reading about Suffix Trees moved on to DAWG then CDAWG. I implemented Suffix Tree, but it is memory expensive.
2. Looks like a very efficient data structure and I did not find a good version of this anywhere. 
3. It is an advanced data structure, so this probably would be implemented in advanced circles that can afford it.
4. Let's be honest, the more open libraries the more building blocks you have. I've benefitted a lot from having building blocks, so might as well contribute some as well.

# Feature requests

Request for the author to implement features will automatically be denied. I did this for fun. I like ideas, but I cannot hold myself to implement them.

You should look at forking, making features and then possibly contributing them back or create an issue to let me know of what you've done.

Implementing and contributing in a different language is more than welcome.

# Plan

This library is built or will be in these languages:

1. Javascript (easiest language to iterate in and solidfy)
2. Rust (After iteratng)
3. Java (maybe)
